                <h4>Networking</h4>
                <p>
                Networking is used by professionals to widen their circles of acquaintances, find out about job opportunities, and increase their awareness of news and trends in their fields.
Business owners may network to develop relationships with people and companies they may do business with in the future.</p>
<p>Professional networking platforms provide an online location for people to engage with other professionals, join groups, post blogs, and share information.
The coronavirus pandemic drove many professionals to network solely online rather than in person.
Many colleges and universities provide opportunities for alumni to network with one another.
                People generally join networking groups based on a single common point of interest that all members share. The most obvious is a professional affiliation, such as stockbrokers. Still, some people find effective networking opportunities in a college alumni group, a church or synagogue social group, or a private club.
             For professionals, the best networking opportunities may occur at trade shows, seminars, and conferences, designed to attract a large crowd of like-minded individuals. Networking helps a professional keep up with current events in the field and develops relationships 
             that may boost future business or employment prospects.Needless to say, it also provides opportunities to help other people find jobs, make connections, and catch up on the news.

            Professional networking platforms such as LinkedIn provide an online location for people to engage with other professionals, join groups, post blogs, and share information. And, of course, they provide a place to post a resume that can be seen by prospective employers, to search for jobs, or to identify job candidates.
These days, a business-to-business (B2B) customer pipeline can be developed almost entirely through the use of a social networking site. Online networking forums allow professionals to demonstrate their knowledge and connect with like-minded people.
LinkedIn is the largest professional network, but there are many others.
 Some cater to particular subsets of people, such as Black Business Women Online. Others have a different focus, such as Meetup, which encourages its members to meet in person off-site or virtually through online video conferences.
